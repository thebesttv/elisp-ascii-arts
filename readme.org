#+title: ELisp ASCII Arts

There are three programs, under their separate directory:
- =ascii=: a small ASCII gallery, displays a star wars animation (taken
  from [[http://www.asciimation.co.nz/index.php][ASCIIMATION]]) or a favicon
- =fire=: draws a flaming fire (either black & white or with colors)
- =bastard-excuses=: generate silly excuses

* ASCII

=ascii.el= starts up a simple interactive server, displaying files under
=gallery/=.  Each file is a separate "artwork", either an animation or a
still picture.  The first line of the file indicates its type:
- For an animation (e.g. =star-wars=), the first line is the title of
  the animation + space + "A".  The second line has 3 numbers separated
  by space: frame witdh, frame height, and the length of a time slice
  (in ms).  For example
  #+begin_src text
    Star Wars  A
    67 13 66.67
  #+end_src
  Then each frame follows, for example:
  #+begin_src text
    4
        ..........           @@@@@    @@@@@.......
         .........          @     @  @     @.......
          ........             @@@   @     @........
           .......           @@      @     @  .......
            ......          @@@@@@@   @@@@@  th ......
             .....        ----------------------- .....
              ....          C  E  N  T  U  R  Y     ....
               ...        -----------------------     ...
                ..        @@@@@ @@@@@ @   @ @@@@@       ..
                ==          @   @      @ @    @          ==
              __||__        @   @@@@    @     @        __||__
             |      |       @   @      @ @    @       |      |
    _________|______|_____  @   @@@@@ @   @   @  _____|______|_________
  #+end_src
  The first line is a number, indicating the time slice this frame takes
  (here, 4 units of time, i.e. 66.67 * 4 ms).  Then follows the frame
  content (here it has 13 lines, and each line has at most 67 chars).
- For a still picture (e.g. =favicon=), a single character "S" denotes
  its type.  The rest of the file is simply sent over the socket.  It
  has the same effect as
  #+begin_src bash
    $ tail +2 ascii/gallery/favicon
  #+end_src
  Normal images (jpg, png) can be converted to terminal images using
  [[https://github.com/hzeller/timg][timg]], a terminal image and video viewer.

To start the server, evaluate =ascii.el= and use =netcat= to open port
21812 of localhost:
#+begin_src bash
  nc localhost 21812
#+end_src

* Fire

[[imgs/fire.png]]

=fire.el= is the main implementation.  It uses emacs network process to
display fire.  It draw fire one frame at a time, and only draws when
someone is watching (i.e. connected to the fire server).

The code used to draw file is taken from [[http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib/][AA-lib]], a portable ascii art
GFX library.  The source is from [[http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aa-project/aalib-1.4rc4.tar.gz][=aalib-1.4rc4.tar.gz=]], under
=aalib-1.4.0/src/aafire.c=.

=fire-starter.el= does two things
- it byte compiles =fire.el= for better performance, and
- calls =(fire-start-server)= to start the fire server

=fire-list.el= seems to be a prototype using =echo-server-client=, it
does not work now.

=raw.c= also draws file, but displays file using raw numbers instead of
colors.  When the program starts, press enter to start drawing file.
The font size needs to be very small in order to see the effect.

To see the fire, evaluate =fire-starter.el= and use =netcat= to open
port 21814 of localhost.

* Bastard Excuses

Two files generate excuses in different ways
- =bastard-diy-excuse.el= randomly chooses words from separate lists and
  concats them
- =bastard-excuse.el= chooses random sentences from =bofh-excuses=
